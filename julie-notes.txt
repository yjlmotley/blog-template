For this blog, these were the files that had to be adjusted:
* admin.py
* models.py
* routes.py
* add in the empty_pot.jpg in the image folder
* layout.js
* flux.js
* blog.js
* blogDetails.js
* blog.css

Rest for authentication:
* models.py, routes.py, flux.js, login.js, signup.js



TODOs:
...last working on flux.js (authentication set up) 12.12.24
- [ ] double check error messages clearly coming thru for signup and login - signup especially (same username/email etc.)
- [ ] for the loginIdentifier (do the toLowerCase in the backend only for the email, not in the flux 
 then make the username case sensitive on the signup and login)
- [ ] login: make the forgot ps pass thru the tab key if possible 
- [ ] login: make the forgot ps and the click here to signup prettier (text-sm)
- [ ] signup: make changing the regular ps input also reset the not matching ps
